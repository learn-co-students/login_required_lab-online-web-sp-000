So a session is essentially an open-ended hash that we can nest further hashes that hold relevant data --> ie `:username => "peter"`, `:cart_id => "1473"`...

... and we manually set those nested hashes inside our sessions in our controller methods --> ie `def create` may contain `session[:username]=user.username`...

... and that session is held in the program's temporary directory until the user closes the browser, loses power, etc... or logs out, which is where we typically deliberately destroy the session.... 

... One main thing to note with sessions at this point is that sessions are server-side.  The session content exist on the server, not with the client....

... because sessions contain potentially sensitive information about the user, they need to be continually authenticated. This authentication occurs every request/response cycle...

... To do this, rails sets up yet another `:key=>value` arrangement. and assigns the session to be the value, and the encrypted client-provided cookie data to be the key...  

 ... so we end up with a hash that is like this:
 `:encrypted_cookie_from_client=>"server-side_session_information"`
 ie:
 `"TGxVM3lmeHpvRDdLQlFTYUt2bXZrMDlLWXBFcUQ1eDhDbDRnUldWUVd4bW" => "session" => {"username" => "peter", "cart_id" => "1473"}`...

... the critical point for this authentication to work is in the matching of the main hash key.  The session holds the latest copy of this key, as does the client cookie (albeit encrypted).  The session's key is continually compared against the key that is provided in the client cookie on every request-response event.  The session hash values are identified and exposed only if the two keys match ...  

... if the provided cookie from the client is tampered with, it simply won't match with the server-side session hash key and the sensitive session values remain unexposed...

... once a user is ready to log off the program, the temporary directory containing the session (along with all its values) is wiped, so it is likely a good idea to prompt the user and ask them if they would like to save any temporary information from their session (ie save changes before closing).  This allows the database to be updated with any crucial information that ought to persist until the next session is established...
